            <p style='padding-top:20px;'><b>Interest-Based Advertising</b>.

TaskMasters and affiliate third parties may use cookies and other technologies to place ads where they believe interested Users will see them. In addition to banner ads, TaskMasters may advertise products, companies and events that we think might interest you through the email address you provide. We may incorporate Tracking Technologies into our own Service (including our website and emails) as well as into our ads displayed on other websites and services.  Some of these Tracking Technologies may track your activities across time and services for purposes of associating the different devices you use, and delivering relevant ads and/or other content to you (<b>“Interest-Based Advertising”</b>).</p>

            <li>• Fraud detection (currently carried out by our providers Sift Science and Emailage). Our fraud detection providers also use information relating to you and your use of and activity on the TaskMasters Platform to provide fraud detection services to their other clients;</li>

            </ul>
            <p style='padding-top:20px;'><b>Partners</b>. Some TaskMasters content is "sponsored by" or "presented by" other companies. If you connect to the TaskMasters Platform through a co-branded version of our TaskMasters Platform or otherwise participate in one of our partner programs, we may share information about your use of the TaskMasters Platform with that Partner in order to offer the integrated platform and to evaluate the partner program. We may also share your information with our Partners in order to receive additional information about you, or in order to create offers that may be of interest to you. Please check such Partner’s privacy policy before revealing information about yourself. If you don't want these Partners to have your Personal Information, you can choose to not participate.</p>
            <p><b>Promotions</b>.  When you voluntarily enter a sweepstakes, contest, or other promotion, we share information as set out in the official rules that govern the promotion as well as for administrative purposes and as required by law (e.g., on a winners’ list).  By entering a promotion, you agree to the official rules that govern that promotion, and may, except where prohibited by applicable law, allow the sponsor and/or other entities to use your name, voice, and/or likeness in advertising or marketing materials.  We may occasionally contact you, if you want us to, with information about special events, activities, promotions, contects, submission opportunities, and programs.  You always have the ability, in your Account, to ask TaskMasters not to contact you with this type of information.  Please see the Your Rights and Choices section for more information.</p>
            <p><b>Other Users</b>. TaskMasters facilitates contact between Clients and Taskers and reserves the right to share a Tasker’s contact information (e.g. name, phone number, email, or postal address) with a Client and vice versa, or with their legal or other representative, in order to facilitate: (1) the resolution of a dispute related to or arising from an interaction between two or more Users of the TaskMasters Platform; or (2) the performance of a Task. This exchange of information is a mandatory part of the TaskMasters Platform.</p>
            <p><b>Legal Obligations</b>. TaskMasters and our Third Party Agents may disclose information or User Generated Content, including location data or communication data, to a third party if required or permitted to do so by law or pursuant to a court order, warrant or subpoena. TaskMasters reserves the right to disclose Personal Information from both private and public areas of the Site(s) and the TaskMasters Platform in the absence of a court order, warrant or subpoena, to the extent permitted by applicable law, if we are given reason to believe, in our sole discretion, that someone is causing injury to or interfering with the rights of Users, the general public, or TaskMasters or its partners, parents or affiliates.</p>
            <p>It is our policy to provide notice to Users before producing their information in response to law enforcement requests unless (i) we are prohibited or otherwise constrained by law or court order from doing so, (ii) we have reason to believe the User’s account has been compromised such that the notice would go to the wrong person, or notice would otherwise be counterproductive or would create a risk to safety, or (iii) it is an emergency request and prior notice would be impractical (in which case we may provide notice after the fact).</p>
            <p><b>Merger or Acquisition</b>. TaskMasters reserves the right to share information in connect with, or during negotiations of, any proposed or actual merger, purchase, sale, or any other type of acquisition or business combination of all or any portion of our assets, or transfer of all or a portion of our business to another business.</p>

For example, since children under the age of majority in their jurisdiction of residence are not allowed to register as Users, we need to take reasonable measures to preserve the accuracy of our Users' ages. You may contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@employement.taskmasters.me">privacy@employement.taskmasters.me</a> if there is a need to make a correction to such data.

Please note that your opt-out is limited to the phone number used and will not affect subsequent subscriptions. If you opt-out of only certain communications, other subscription communications may continue. Even if you opt-out of receiving promotional communications, TaskMasters may continue to send you non-promotional communications, such as those about your account, Tasks, transactions, servicing, or TaskMasters’s ongoing business relationship with you.  If you receive unsolicited email from a TaskMasters domain, please let us know, <a href="http://employement.taskmasters.me/contact/" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
            <p><b>Cookies and Pixels</b>.  Most browsers accept cookies by default. You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to decline or delete cookies. If you use multiple browsers on your device, you will need to instruct each browser separately.  Your ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.</p>
            <p><b>Do Not Track</b>. Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to online services you visit.  Note, however, there is no industry consensus as to what site and app operations should do with regard to these signals. Accordingly, unless and until the law is interpreted to require us to do so, we do not monitor or take action with respect to “Do Not Track” signals. For more information on “Do Not Track,” visit <a href="https://www.allaboutdnt.com" target="_blank">https://www.allaboutdnt.com</a>.</p>
            <p><b>App and Location Technologies</b>.  You can stop all collection of information via an app by uninstalling the app.  You can also reset your device Ad Id at any time through your device settings, which is designed to allow you to limit the use of information collected about you.  If you do not want us to use your location anymore for the purposes set forth above, you should turn off the location services for the mobile application located in your device’s account settings, your mobile phone settings, and/or within the mobile application.</p>

            <h2>8. TaskMasters's Information Retention Policy</h2>
            <p>We retain personal data for as long as you are a User in order to meet our contractual obligations to you, and for such longer period as may be in our legitimate interests and to comply with our legal obligations (see Exhibit B for exemplar document retention periods). We may also retain data from which you cannot directly be identified, for example where stored against a randomly-generated identifier so we know the data relates to a single User, but we cannot tell who that User is. We use this kind of data for research purposes and to help us develop and improve our services, and we take appropriate measures to ensure you cannot be re-identified from this data.</p>

However, to the extent “sale” under the CCPA is interpreted to include advertising technology activities such as those disclosed in the TaskMasters’s Use of Information section as a “sale,” we will comply with applicable law as to such activity.</p>
            <p>TaskMasters discloses the following categories of information for commercial purposes:</p>
